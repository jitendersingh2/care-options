                <p>Think of your doctor as your medical &ldquo;home&rdquo;&mdash;or the quarterback of your entire health care team. It's who you should go to for most medical needs, such as preventive care, regular screenings or tests, and illnesses or
                  injuries. It's also the person you talk to about your health questions and concerns.</p>

                <p>Don't have a doctor yet? <a href="http://blog.bcbsnc.com/2015/03/five-tips-for-choosing-a-new-primary-care-physician/" target="_blank">Here are 5 tips for choosing one</a>. Then, use our <a href="http://www.bcbsnc.com/content/providersearch/index.htm"
                      target="_blank">Find a Doctor tool</a> to research your options.</p>
                <p>Finally, fill in your doctor's information on the Quick Reference Guide so it's always handy.</p>

                <h2 class="h4 text-blue-medium">What to expect</h2>
                <p>On average, people spend 18 minutes<sup class="sm">1</sup> waiting to see their doctor&mdash;then get about 21 minutes<sup class="sm">2</sup> in face-to-face time. So, the typical doctor's visit takes only 39 minutes in total. That means
                  you'll save a lot of time compared to a trip to the ER. And it's even quicker than most urgent care centers.</p>
                <p>The cost of a doctor visit depends on your specific health plan. But it's much less than a visit to the ER, where the average member cost is $453.<sup class="sm">3</sup> And the copay or coinsurance for a doctor visit is often less
                  than what you'd pay at an urgent care clinic, too. </p>
                <p>All in all, you'll save the most time and money by going to your doctor for any health care need that isn't a true emergency!</p>

                <h2 class="h4 text-blue-medium">A relationship that's important for your health</h2>
                <p>Some people have seen the same doctor for decades. But even if you're just starting to see a doctor, the relationship is still an important one to build up. Here's why:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li><strong>They get to know you:</strong> Your doctor gets to know your health, so they're able to provide you with the best overall care. They also are key to managing any long-term health conditions&mdash;or lowering your chance of getting
                    them in the first place.</li>
                  <li><strong>You save time:</strong> When you have a health history with a doctor, it saves you time and cuts down on paperwork. Plus, visits are usually much quicker than at the ER or urgent care. And many doctors offer walk-in and same-day
                    appointments&mdash;as well as weekend hours and after-hours phone lines. </li>
                  <li><strong>You save money:</strong> Seeing your doctor usually means lower copays or costs compared to other care options. Over time, getting regular care from you doctor helps prevent costly health problems in the future, and can
                    keep you out of the hospital.</li>

                <p>If you can't get a same-day appointment with your doctor, urgent care centers are a good back-up option for issues that just can't wait. Their aim is to treat patients quickly and efficiently. Problems like a cut finger, sprained ankle
                  or severe cough are good reasons to visit urgent care.</p>

                <p>In North Carolina alone, there are more than 240 dedicated urgent care clinics. Most are open seven days a week and offer extended hours, including
                  weekends and evenings. Some areas even have around-the-clock urgent care options.</p>

                <h2 class="h4 text-blue-medium">What to expect</h2>
                <p>Typically, you'll wait 30 minutes or less to see a nurse practitioner or doctor at an urgent care center&mdash;and spend 1 hour or less in total for a visit.<sup class="sm">5</sup> That's longer than the average visit to your doctor, but
                  still much better than a trip to the ER.</p>
                <p>The same is true of costs. The average Blue Cross NC member will pay $57 for an urgent care visit.<sup class="sm">3</sup> That's more than the copay or coinsurance you'll pay for a doctor visit under most health plans. Yet it's quite a deal
                  compared to the emergency room, where the average member will pay nearly 8 times that amount!<sup class="sm">3</sup></p>


                <h2 class="h4">Convenience care centers or retail clinics</h2>
                <p>For minor health issues, convenience care centers are another back-up option. These are walk-in clinics with extended hours, where you can get basic care from a nurse practitioner. Some are even housed within retail stores, making them a quick and easy spot to get your yearly flu shot. They can treat
                  common illnesses like sinus infections, colds, flu, allergies, urinary tract infections or sore throats.</p>
                <p>As the name implies, these clinics are convenient. Because the health problems are minor, a typical visit takes just 45 minutes.<sup class="sm">1,2</sup> And the average Blue Cross NC member cost is only 13.<sup class="sm">3</sup></p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you do visit an urgent care or convenience care center, let your doctor know about it. That way, your medical record can be updated and stay accurate.</p>

                  <h4>Remember:</h4>
                  <p>If you have an issue that threatens your life or health, never wait. Call 911 or go straight to the nearest emergency room!</p>
                </div>

                <p>The emergency room is your best option if:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li><strong>You feel your life is in danger:</strong> For example, chest pains, seizures, can't breathe or head trauma.</li>
                  <li><strong>You need major care right away:</strong> For example, broken bones, major burns or heavy bleeding.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Think of the ER as a last resort for true emergencies that require immediate, specialized care.</p>

                <h2 class="h4 text-blue-medium">What to expect</h2>
                <p>Since the emergency room is built to deal with life-or-death situations, it's the most expensive and time-consuming care option you have.</p>
                <p>In North Carolina, you'll wait nearly 30 minutes on average until you first see a doctor in the ER.<sup class="sm">1</sup> However, the typical visit ends up being a whopping 2 hours and 33 minutes in total!<sup class="sm">2</sup> That's because
                  the doctor is first looking to see if your life is in danger. If it's not, the doctor will often get pulled into caring for more critical patients first. And the more emergencies that come through the door&mdash;the more hours it'll
                  take before you walk out of the ER.</p>
                <p>Cost is also much different at the emergency room. Blue Cross NC members pay an average of $453 for an ER visit.<sup class="sm">3</sup> <b>That's 12 times more than a doctor visit, 8 times more than urgent careâ€”and 35 times more than a retail clinic</p>
                <p>Those dollars add up. So, the more we can choose the right care option&mdash;the more we can help lower health care costs for everyone. Plus, we'll be freeing up valuable ER resources to focus on helping those that truly need life-saving
                  care!
                </p>

                <h2 class="h4">Emergency care vs. your doctor's care</h2>
                <p>Some people think they'll get the best health care at the ER. But the truth is that for issues that aren't life-threatening or very severe, you'll get the best care at your doctor. Here's why:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li><strong>The ER's job is to make sure you survive:</strong> They measure success by whether you walk out the door. So their goal is to figure out what you DON'T have by ruling out life-threatening conditions. When you go in for a non-emergency,
                    the ER typically only treats your symptoms&mdash;not what's actually causing those symptoms. And that raises the risk that the same problem (or a similar one) will happen again in the future.</li>
                  <li><strong>Your doctor is there to help you over the long haul:</strong> As your medical &ldquo;home,&rdquo; your doctor supports both your current health and your future wellbeing. They'll not only treat the health problems you have today,
                    but help you prevent them from happening again. And they will be in the best position to do that because they know your health history. Things like daily habits, medicines and family history play a big role in your health. So having
                    a doctor that knows those things means you'll get personalized care that's best for you and your unique needs!</li>

            <h1 class="h1">Next Steps</h1>
            <p>Now that you have a clear picture of your options, what's next? Here are several things you can do today so it's easier to make smart care choices in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">1) Select a doctor (if you don't already have one).</h2>
            <p>If you don't have a doctor yet, first read <a href="http://blog.bcbsnc.com/2015/03/five-tips-for-choosing-a-new-primary-care-physician/" target="_blank">these 5 tips for choosing one</a>. Then, use <a href="http://www.bcbsnc.com/content/providersearch/index.htm"
                  target="_blank">our Find a Doctor tool</a> to choose one and schedule an initial health checkup.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">2) Add Health Line Blue to your phone's contact list.</h2>
            <p>Never used Health Line Blue? Often, making that first call helps you feel comfortable using it in the future. So do it today by calling 1-877-477-2424. (Save this number in your phone for easy access.) You can ask any health questions that

            <h2 class="h2">3) Use your Quick Reference Guide.</h2>

              phone so it's handy. It provides at-a-glance information on the care options we've talked about. So when a health problem crops up, you'll know what to do!</p>

            <h2 class="h2">4) Choose your back-up option by locating an urgent care center close to home.</h2>
